## Voluntary frontend assignment 
This assignment is made as part of an internship application @ CEGO. 

### Description
My solution is made as simple as possible while trying to comply with the description of the assignment. 
[Solution can be seen live here.](https://cego.netlify.app/)

The homepage of the solution servers all games and clicking on an individual game takes you to that particular game. This is done dynamically with Vue router using and the id for each game as a parameter. A nice addition could be turning the title of each game into a slug and use that instead. 
On the page for each individual game you get a larger overview, including a description of the game and its tags. A tag view could be added for when clicking a tag, games with that tag are rendered. 

As of now, there's an error with the footer when viewing all games on mobile devices, where the position doesn't match the intended. The error does not exist using responsive mode on desktop.
